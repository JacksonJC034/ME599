% OUTPUTS: (from documentation)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% coeff: A matrix of principal component coefficients (also known as loadings or eigenvectors), 
% where each column represents a principal component, and rows correspond to the original variables. 
% The columns are in order of decreasing component variance.

% score: The representation of 'X'(train_data) in the principal component space. 
% Rows of 'score' correspond to observations, and columns to components.

% latent: A vector containing the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of 'X', 
% which represent the variance explained by the corresponding principal components.

% tsquared: Hotellingts T-squared statistic for each observation.

% explained: A vector containing the percentage of the total variance 
% explained by each principal component.

% mu: A vector of the mean of each variable in 'X', used to center the data during the PCA process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
